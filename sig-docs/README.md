# SIG Docs

Documentation is key to the success of an open source project. There will be a lot of documentation work during the operation of open source projects, and the documents written by different developers will be very different, especially the documents released to the outside world. SIG Docs is responsible for polishing and proofreading these documents, raising the quality of the documents to a higher level.

The [charter](charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the Docs Special Interest Group.
