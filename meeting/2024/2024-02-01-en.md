## Meeting Content
1. **Recent Key Work**
   - Release of CubeFS v3.3.2
   - New Features:
     - ObjectNode supports POST form upload.
     - ObjectNode supports STS and comprehensive signature authentication.
     - ObjectNode libsdk and MetaNode support directory locking.
   - Optimizations:
     - ObjectNode sharding upload concurrency safety mechanism.

2. **Introduction to CubeFS RDMA Features**
   - CubeFS has been improved for faster write speeds in large model scenarios by adding RDMA support to reduce CPU overhead, primarily supporting the write process.
   - The solution involves dividing request packets into two parts:
     - Headers carry keys and other information, and then the server actively reads to complete data transfer.
     - Servers share the same memory pool to achieve zero-copy data transfer between them.
